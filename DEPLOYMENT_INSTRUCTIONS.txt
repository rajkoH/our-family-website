GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

Your site will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the main branch!

SETUP STEPS (ONE-TIME):
-----------------------

1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add deployment workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Configure GitHub Pages in your repository:

   a. Go to your GitHub repository
   b. Click "Settings" (top right)
   c. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
   d. Under "Build and deployment":
      - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   e. Save

3. Update astro.config.ts (if needed):

   If your repo is named something other than your username.github.io,
   you need to set the base path:

   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     site: 'https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io',
     base: '/YOUR_REPO_NAME',
     // ... rest of config
   });
   ```

   For example, if your repo is "rajkoH":
   - site: 'https://yourusername.github.io'
   - base: '/rajkoH'

THAT'S IT!
----------

From now on, every time you push code:
1. GitHub Actions automatically builds your site
2. Deploys to GitHub Pages
3. Your site updates within 1-2 minutes

VIEW YOUR SITE:
--------------
- If repo is username.github.io: https://username.github.io/
- Otherwise: https://username.github.io/repo-name/

MONITOR DEPLOYMENTS:
-------------------
- Go to "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
- You'll see each deployment and its status
- Click on any deployment to see detailed logs

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error logs
2. Ensure Node.js version matches (v20 in workflow)
3. Make sure all dependencies are in package.json
4. Verify build works locally: npm run build

CUSTOM DOMAIN (OPTIONAL):
-------------------------
To use a custom domain:
1. Add a CNAME file to /public/ with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings
