    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We met online in 2018, and within a few messages, we both decided to meet in person rather than spend too much
        time chatting. Our first date started with coffee that quickly turned into dinner at a dim sum restaurant. Both
        of us, trying to impress each other with our adventurous palates, ordered cold webbed-duck feet - which took us
        both by surprise! After dinner, we went to a light exhibit downtown, and what was supposed to be a simple first
        date turned into 8 hours of conversation, laughter, and discovering we had found something special.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We quickly discovered we share a deep love of new adventures together - skiing down mountains, camping under the
        stars, traveling to new places, and most importantly, our passion for food and exploring different cuisines and
        culture. Our relationship grew organically through weekend adventures exploring the city, quiet evenings cooking
        dinner together, and countless conversations about life, dreams, and what we wanted from our future. We
        discovered we shared the same values: the importance of family, the joy of creating a warm home, and a deep
        desire to make a positive impact in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In the middle of COVID, we took a leap and moved to Italy together while Dylan studied his MBA. It was a
        challenging time that tested us in ways we never expected, but it ultimately brought us closer. Navigating a
        pandemic in a foreign country taught us that we could face anything as long as we faced it together.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In June 2022, we took a major step in our journey together and bought our first home - a small townhouse in
        downtown Toronto. It&apos;s only 12 feet wide, but we absolutely love it. It&apos;s our cozy sanctuary in the
        heart of the city, and we&apos;ve filled it with memories, laughter, and dreams for the future.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        On March 29th, 2025, we got married in a beautiful ceremony surrounded by family and friends. It was a
        celebration of not just our love, but of the life we&apos;d already built together and the future we were
        excited to create.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        When we got married, we knew we wanted to share a family name - one that we would give to our children one day.
        Rather than merging our both long 10-letter last names (Ciccarelli and Hristovski), we decided to create
        something new together. We combined them to form <span class="font-semibold text-primary">Ciccovski</span> - a name
        that represents both of our heritages and the new family we&apos;re building together.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We&apos;ve created a home that reflects who we are - warm, welcoming, and filled with personal touches. Our
        weekends are spent exploring Toronto&apos;s neighborhoods, trying new restaurants, visiting farmers markets, and
        spending time with the people we love. We&apos;re both passionate about our careers but never lose sight of what
        matters most - our relationship and our dreams for the future.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We&apos;re fortunate to be surrounded by an incredible support network. Our families are close, involved, and
        excited about our journey. We have friends who have become chosen family, and together we&apos;ve created a
        community built on love, acceptance, and mutual support.

    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        From early in our relationship, we talked about having children. We&apos;ve always known that parenthood was
        part of our future, and as our relationship deepened and our lives became more stable, that dream became more
        tangible.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We&apos;ve spent years preparing - emotionally, financially, and practically. We&apos;ve talked to other
        families who&apos;ve been through surrogacy, learned from their experiences, and thought deeply about what kind
        of parents we want to be. We&apos;ve prepared our home and our lives to welcome a child with all the love and
        stability they deserve.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Surrogacy is a deeply personal choice, and we&apos;ve given it the consideration and respect it deserves. We
        understand that this journey isn&apos;t just about us - it&apos;s about partnership, trust, and creating
        something beautiful together with someone who shares our hope for bringing new life into the world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold text-primary">
        We&apos;re ready. Ready to be parents, ready to give a child all the love we have, and ready to build a
        meaningful connection with someone who will help make this dream a reality.

          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Dylan was born in March 1994 in downtown Toronto as the only child to his parents, Brad and Kadi. Growing
              up, he was both studious and athletic - the kind of kid who excelled in the classroom and on the field.
              His academic journey took him to Colby College for his undergraduate degree and then to Bocconi University
              in Milan, where he earned his MBA. Today, he works as a Manager in Strategy Execution at the Canadian
              Pension Plan Investment Board.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Dylan is a big personality who is unapologetically himself. He&apos;s an introvert who finds joy in the
              quiet moments - curled up with a good book or diving deep into a topic that fascinates him. He&apos;s
              basically a walking encyclopedia, and you&apos;ll definitely want him on your trivia team! His mind is
              constantly curious, always learning, always growing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              What makes Dylan special is his thoughtfulness. He&apos;s the kind of friend who remembers the small
              details, who shows up when it matters, and who approaches relationships with genuine care and
              consideration. As a parent, he&apos;ll be the one reading bedtime stories with different voices for each
              character, answering endless &quot;why&quot; questions with patience and enthusiasm, and teaching our
              child that being yourself - whoever that is - is the best thing you can be.

              Ryan was born in September 1995 in Barrie, Ontario, to his parents Peter and Nancy. He has one brother,
              Elliot, who is also his best friend. Ryan is the proud godfather to Elliot&apos;s daughter, our prized and
              beautiful niece Ellie, who brings endless joy to our lives. Family has always been at the center of
              Ryan&apos;s world, and he carries those values into everything he does.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Ryan studied Computer Science at Brock University and has a deep passion for learning about technology. He
              works as a Software Developer at Robinhood, where he gets to combine his love of problem-solving with his
              technical skills. But what really lights Ryan up is being around people - he&apos;s an extrovert who
              thrives on connection and energy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              You&apos;ll find Ryan cooking up something delicious in his wok, getting lost in a fantasy novel, carving
              down a ski slope, or dancing like nobody&apos;s watching (or like everyone is - he doesn&apos;t mind
              either way!). He&apos;s a kind and thoughtful person who connects deeply with nature and finds peace in
              the outdoors. As a parent, he&apos;ll be the one teaching our child to ski, cooking family dinners
              together, sharing his love of adventure, and showing them that life is meant to be lived with joy,
              curiosity, and an open heart.
